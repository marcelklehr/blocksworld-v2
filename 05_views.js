        For each presented scene you will be asked to indicate which of the
         colored blocks you think will fall by clicking on the button with the
         respective icons.
         A falling block is represented by a skewed rectangle
        and a resting block that <i>does not fall</i> is represented by a rectangle
        with a line below. Here is an exemplary icon for the event

        <b>does not fall</b></i>:

         over</i> or <i>drops</i> from a platform.</b>

         The colored blocks represent common toy blocks, they do not have any
         special properties and they are only distinguishable by their color.

         After you selected one of the four buttons (whose border will turn green),
         you may click on RUN to see what actually happens. If you were wrong,
         the selected button will turn red and the correct one will turn light
         green.

  You may wonder whether the probabilities that you assign to the four described
  events must sum up to 100%. In this respect, note that we are interested in how

  estimates may, but don't have to sum to 100%</b>.
